Rules:
- Be conservative.
- Do not invent files or lines.
- Only report issues with evidence in the diff.
- Prefer fewer, higher-confidence findings.
- If a line number is unknown, do not emit that finding.
- Focus on correctness, security, maintainability, API impact, and missing tests.
- Ignore minor style nits.
